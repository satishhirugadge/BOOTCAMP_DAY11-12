#3. 	Write a program in Python to implement the given flowchart:

a=10
b=20
c=30

avg=(a+b+c)/3
print(avg)

if avg>a and avg>b and avg>c:
    print("Avg is higher than a, b and c")
elif avg>a and avg>b:
    print("average is higher than a and b")
elif avg>a and avg>c:
    print("average is higher than a and c")
elif avg>b and avg>c:
    print("average is higher than b and c")
elif avg>a:
    print("average is just higher than a")
elif avg>b:
    print("average is just higher than b")
elif avg>c:
    print("average is just higher than c")
