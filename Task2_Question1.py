# 1.	Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
# If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
# If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “c” as a string
# If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd Python Training” as a string.

# If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
num1=int(input("Enter a Number???"))  
if num1%3==0:
    print("Consultadd")
# print( type("Consultadd"))  it is givint the str


# If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “c” as a string
num2=int(input("Enter a Number???"))  
if num2%5==0:
    print("c")


 # If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd Python Training” as a string.
num3=int(input("Enter a Number???"))  
if num3%3==0 and num3%5==0:       #both  3 and 5 for example 15, 30
    print("Consultadd Python Training")
